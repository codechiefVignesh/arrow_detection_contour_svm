# Arrow Detection and Classification in ROS1
## Methods used
> 1) Contour detection using opencv
> 2) Using Support Vector Machine to classify the arrows
> 3) Using High Performance EfficientNet, a CNN based model to improve the classification

In the launch file there are three statements each with a node representing each method

I have also added the svm classifier and cnn based classifier jupyter notebook.
